This project was my take on building a "simulated annealing" algorithm from the ground up.

It's a classic optimization method, and I wanted to see if I could implement it myself. To make sure it actually worked well, I put it through its paces by testing it against the 57 standard benchmark functionsâ€”a pretty tough obstacle course for this kind of stuff.

This repository holds the code for the algorithm itself and all the test functions I used to validate it.
